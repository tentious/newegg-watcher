# newegg-watcher
A Golang inventory monitoring/notification script for [newegg.com](http://newegg.com)
#### Why?
Because newegg's auto-notify is not always available for certain products. Also, this script is much faster at detecting inventory and sending out emails.

## requirements
 - Be sure that golang is installed. If not, get it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
 - Google email address. **NOTE** you must allow less secure apps to access your account. [Learn More](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)
